## 0.4.15

### Patch Changes

- e6f51cd: Changed MCP servers to expose progressive tool discovery by default.

## 0.4.14

### Patch Changes

- 539d0ac: Added `compact` and `security` OpenAPI config options for trimming generated command schemas and skipping credential option injection.
- 4c0fc4b: Included OpenAPI operation descriptions in MCP tool descriptions by concatenating summary and description; CLI help keeps the short summary.

## 0.4.13

### Patch Changes

- 20a6f42: Added MCP tool filtering via `mcp: false` on commands and root-level `mcp.tools` include/exclude patterns.
- 3fecb7c: Added remote MCP servers as command sources via `cli.command(name, { mcp })`.
- 11b7406: Added `context.request` for HTTP and MCP invocations and `openapiConfig.forwardHeaders` for propagating caller headers to upstream APIs.

## 0.4.12

### Patch Changes

- c37c5f7: Respect explicit output formats when stdout is a TTY so `--format` and `--json` output remains machine-readable.

## 0.4.11

### Patch Changes

- 4de8518: Fixed `--mcp` stdio transport loading against `@modelcontextprotocol/server` prereleases that export it from `./stdio`.

## 0.4.10

### Patch Changes

- a94480c: Added `mcp doctor` command that smoke-tests MCP initialization and tool listing without calling tools.
- f069769: Added MCP tool name and description metadata overrides for commands, including duplicate exposed-name validation.
- 309d566: Added support for non-object MCP output schemas by omitting them from tool registration while preserving JSON text output.

## 0.4.9

### Patch Changes

- 0720a24: Added custom global options support via `globals` and `globalAlias` on `Cli.create()`.
- 7e94269: Added destructive command hints to generated skill files.
- a14e41d: Fixed BigInt serialization across JSON, JSONL, MCP, and fetch output paths.
- cb05897: Fixed MCP registration command detection for global, local, and source-launched CLIs.
- 15c9068: Defaulted MCP-over-HTTP to stateless transport behavior and returned `405` for unsupported stateless methods.
- 1c52be9: Lazy-loaded YAML and MCP SDK imports outside plain command runs.
- dc0faff: Added typed MCP command metadata for `instructions` and `annotations`.
- 1cbe459: Fixed HTTP and MCP command input validation to return standard validation field errors for object-shaped inputs.
- 43c1551: Added `banner` option to `Cli.create` for displaying custom content above root help output with sync/async functions, error swallowing, and `mode` targeting.
- a0f469f: Fixed streaming command terminal records so HTTP NDJSON responses preserved returned `c.ok()` CTA metadata, represented returned or yielded `c.error()` values as terminal errors, included terminal duration metadata, unwound generators on response cancellation, and preserved `IncurError.retryable` metadata in streaming machine-format errors.
- 9a43129: Surfaced `c.ok(..., { cta })` metadata on MCP tool responses under `_meta.cta`.
- a0f469f: Fixed generated and synced skills to use the same command projection as CLI skill output, avoided duplicate skills for command aliases, preserved output schemas and examples consistently, and included the fetch gateway skill hint for fetch-based commands.
- bffbdf4: Typed the root command `hint` option on `Cli.create`.

## 0.4.8

### Patch Changes

- 935e6f7: Generated OpenAPI commands accepted header parameters and header security schemes as CLI options.

## 0.4.7

### Patch Changes

- 01b5c91: Added `openapiConfig.mode` for choosing operation id or namespace command generation.
- bfc05ac: Added hosted OpenAPI command generation from `Fetch.fromRequest` sources.

## 0.4.6

### Patch Changes

- ed18ddc: Added support for automatic OpenAPI v3.2.0 schema generation

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- 85e98bc: Fixed `--json` to emit parsed JSON objects and arrays instead of double-encoding top-level JSON strings.
- 3124fe7: Clarified TTY validation output for missing options and environment variables.

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- 9875d59: Fixed skill frontmatter generation and parsing so descriptions containing YAML-sensitive text like `key: value` were quoted and read correctly.

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- 01c675f: Added `ls` alias for `skills list`.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- a6c584d: Fixed stale skills warnings to only appear when synced skill files were still installed on disk, and updated `skills list` to reflect actual install state instead of stale metadata.

## 0.4.1

### Minor Changes

- 1e58e47: **Breaking:** Renamed the global full-envelope flag from `--verbose` to `--full-output`, allowing `--verbose` to be used as a normal command option.

## 0.3.25

### Patch Changes

- abfa8c7: Fixed Root CLIs created with `Cli.create` and `aliases` not registering those aliases as command aliases when mounted via `cli.command()`.

## 0.3.24

### Patch Changes

- 250e65f: Added command-level `aliases` option for subcommands (e.g. `aliases: ['extensions', 'ext']` on an `extension` command).
- 26d7bf8: Fixed root fetch/command fallback bypassing "Did you mean?" suggestions when the input is a typo of a known command.

## 0.3.23

### Patch Changes

- 572c172: Replaced `@readme/openapi-parser` with a vendored `dereference` implementation, removing a heavy dependency tree.

## 0.3.22

### Patch Changes

- bfc3337: Replaced `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` with `@modelcontextprotocol/server` (v2), reducing dependency count by 74 packages.

## 0.3.21

### Patch Changes

- d091bf7: Fixed stale `skills add` CTA commands to use the invoked CLI name when running installed binaries directly, instead of falling back to `npx`.

## 0.3.20

### Patch Changes

- ede37be: Fixed help output for boolean options so flags no longer showed `<boolean>` placeholders or redundant `(default: false)` text, including aliased flags.
- 96dfee4: Exported shell completion environment variables in bash and zsh hooks.

## 0.3.19

### Patch Changes

- 5c76b51: Fixed `skills add` to list synced skills in alphabetical order.

## 0.3.18

### Patch Changes

- a65c865: Used command description as fallback in skill frontmatter for root commands and single-command groups.

## 0.3.17

### Patch Changes

- dad62c9: Fixed `skills list` not including root command skill.

## 0.3.16

### Patch Changes

- de70444: Added `engines` field requiring Node.js >=22.
- 3462433: Fixed `z.bigint()`, `z.coerce.bigint()`, `z.date()`, and `z.coerce.date()` schemas failing during skill sync by representing them as `{ type: "string" }` in JSON Schema output.

## 0.3.15

### Patch Changes

- abd80e7: Fixed missing value errors for flags in `Fetch.parseArgv`, short secret leaking in `redact()`, silent `jsonl` fallthrough in `Formatter.format`, invalid `--format`/`--token-limit`/`--token-offset` values, lost descriptions when coercing OpenAPI param schemas, and hardcoded `process.env` in `Help.ts` for Deno compatibility.
- 7dd398b: Added `skills list` subcommand that shows all skills a CLI defines with install status.

## 0.3.14

### Patch Changes

- 71a787a: Fixed root commands defined on `Cli.create()` not being included in skill generation (`--llms`, `skills add`, `.well-known/skills/`).

## 0.3.13

### Patch Changes

- 0e0549f: Added `displayName` to the root `Cli.create(..., { run })` context type.

## 0.3.12

### Patch Changes

- b8370ac: Added `displayName` to the run and middleware context. Resolves the actual binary name from `process.argv[1]` so user-facing messages reflect the alias used to invoke the CLI.

## 0.3.11

### Patch Changes

- 7833e33: Updated command suggestion ranking to use tiered scoring (prefix → contains → fuzzy) so match type outranks raw edit distance.

## 0.3.10

### Patch Changes

- d1404b8: Fixed optional properties being typed as required in typegen output.

## 0.3.9

### Patch Changes

- 8ee1af4: Fixed skill display names to use canonical slug from SKILL.md frontmatter instead of reconstructing from CLI name and subcommand.

## 0.3.8

### Patch Changes

- 69a48ce: Tweaked "Did you mean" output.

## 0.3.7

### Patch Changes

- 2f8194b: Added "Did you mean?" suggestions for mistyped commands using Levenshtein distance. Includes builtin commands (`mcp`, `skills`, `completions`) in suggestion candidates. Suggestion CTA preserves original args/flags. Moved skills staleness warning from stderr into the CTA system.

## 0.3.6

### Patch Changes

- 9b2ab98: Updated help output

## 0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- 8952a65: Fixed built-in commands (`skills`, `mcp`) showing root command errors when invoked without subcommand. Bare `skills`/`mcp` and `--help` now show their own help with available subcommands. Added built-in commands to shell completions. Fixed skill name sanitization for CLI names containing dots.
- 05d89f3: Fixed `resolvePackageRoot` failing with `ENOENT` when running from a Bun compiled binary.
- 64295d2: Added unified command execution across CLI, HTTP, and MCP transports.

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- 83aa331: Tweaked help and CTA outputs.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 8adbfbc: Tweaked help output

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- d2ef65b: Added enum and union-of-literal values in help text instead of generic `<value>` placeholder.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 1f5a2df: Added support for count options via `.meta({ count: true })` on `z.number().default(0)` schemas. Count flags behave like booleans (no value consumed), but increment on each occurrence, supporting both repeated flags (`--verbose --verbose`) and stacked aliases (`-vvv`).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 9add1a0: **Breaking:** Renamed `--llms` to `--llms-full`. Added a new `--llms` flag that outputs a compact command index (table of command signatures + descriptions) instead of the full manifest. This reduced token usage by ~95% for agents that already know the CLI and just need a quick reminder of available commands.

### Patch Changes

- a2610bc: Added `requires_bin` and fallback descriptions to generated skill frontmatter.
- dd7a1af: Fixed `--no-global` resolving `cwd` to the CLI's installation directory instead of `process.cwd()`.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 9454412: Added `--token-count`, `--token-limit`, and `--token-offset` global options for token-aware output pagination. Uses LLM tokenization estimation (~96% accuracy via `tokenx`). In `--verbose` mode, truncated output includes `meta.nextOffset` for programmatic pagination.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 6ab9a33: Added `--filter-output` global option to filter output by key paths with support for dot notation and array slicing.
- 2dc1b00: Added `--schema` global option to every command that returns its JSON Schema (args, env, options, output).
- c60e6b8: Exposed `format` and `formatExplicit` on run and middleware context.
- 0e52ec0: Added `cli.fetch` to expose CLI as a standard Fetch API handler
- f5b0133: Added optional exitCode to c.error() and IncurError, allowing CLI authors to control the process exit code. Defaults to 1 when omitted (backward compatible).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 00b0b2d: Added Fetch API integration — mount any HTTP server as a CLI command.
  - **Fetch gateway**: `.command('api', { fetch: app.fetch })` translates argv into HTTP requests using curl-style flags (`-X`, `-d`, `-H`, `--key value` query params)
  - **Streaming**: NDJSON responses (`application/x-ndjson`) are streamed incrementally
  - **OpenAPI support**: `.command('api', { fetch, openapi: spec })` generates typed subcommands with args, options, and descriptions from an OpenAPI 3.x spec
  - Works with any framework exposing a Web Fetch API handler (Hono, Elysia, etc.)

## 0.1.17

### Patch Changes

- b73feaf: Added `aliases` option to `Cli.create` for registering alternative binary names. Shell completions and help output include all aliases.

## 0.1.16

### Patch Changes

- e3aa038: Added dynamic shell completions for bash, zsh, fish, and nushell. CLIs get a built-in `completions <shell>` command that outputs a hook script. The hook calls back into the binary at every tab press, so completions stay in sync with commands automatically. Supports subcommands, `--options`, short aliases, enum values, and space suppression for command groups.
- 06580f0: Added short-alias stacking (e.g. `-abc` parsed as `-a -b -c`). The last flag in a stack can consume a value; all preceding flags must be boolean.

## 0.1.15

### Patch Changes

- 5122c9b: Fixed help formatter using `process.env` instead of env source override for "set:" display

## 0.1.14

### Patch Changes

- 3f7ca73: Added leading `#` to CTA command descriptions for easier copy-paste.
- 3f7ca73: Moved environment variables section to bottom of help output.
- 3f7ca73: Fixed invalid subcommand in a group falling through to root handler instead of returning `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND`. Added CTA with copyable help command to `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND` errors.
- 50282a8: Added redacted current value indicator for environment variables in help output.
- 79fbabd: Fixed streaming handler ignoring CLI-level and command-level default `format`. Previously, `handleStreaming` used only `formatExplicit` to decide between incremental and buffered mode, causing CLI defaults like `{ format: 'json' }` to be ignored in favor of hardcoded `'toon'`.

## 0.1.13

### Patch Changes

- aa32795: Added `version` to the command run context (`c.version`).

## 0.1.12

### Patch Changes

- a61c474: Added help output in human mode for root command with args when no args provided

## 0.1.11

### Patch Changes

- 77f5c98: Added deprecated option support via Zod's `.meta({ deprecated: true })`. Deprecated flags show `[deprecated]` in help output, `**Deprecated.**` in skill docs, `deprecated: true` in JSON Schema, and emit stderr warnings in TTY mode.

## 0.1.10

### Patch Changes

- e7564a0: Added `c.error()` to middleware context for structured error short-circuiting. Middleware can now return `c.error({ code, message })` instead of throwing, producing a proper error envelope with optional CTAs.

## 0.1.9

### Patch Changes

- 1a671e9: Added `name` to run and middleware context (`c.name`) — returns the CLI name passed to `Cli.create()`.

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- eec5906: Added `c.env` to middleware context. CLI-level `env` schema defined on `Cli.create()` is now parsed before middleware runs and available as typed `c.env` in both `.use()` and per-command `middleware: [...]` handlers. This enables initializing shared dependencies (API clients, auth tokens) in middleware using validated environment variables instead of reading `process.env` directly.

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- 2c60110: - Added middleware support via `cli.use()`.
  - Added typed dependency injection via `vars`: declare a Zod schema on `create()` (and optionally set defaults), set values with `c.set()` in middleware, read them via `c.var` in handlers.
- ba07f0b: Added per-command middleware via `middleware` property on command definitions. Added `middleware()` helper for creating strictly typed middleware handlers with `middleware<typeof cli.vars>(...)`. Added `cli.vars` property to expose the vars schema for use with `typeof`.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 6642c48: Added `agent` boolean to the `run` context. `true` when stdout is not a TTY (piped/agent consumer), `false` when running in a terminal. Use it to tailor command behavior for agents vs humans.
- 6642c48: Added `outputPolicy` option to commands, groups, and root CLIs. Set `outputPolicy: 'agent-only'` to suppress data output in human/TTY mode while still returning structured data to agents. Defaults to `'all'`. Inherited from parent groups — children can override.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- b334523: Added automatic cleanup of stale skills when commands are removed or depth changes.
  Fixed broken symlinks not being removed on Node v24.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 9bb41e3: Fixed `--depth=N` equals syntax not being parsed in `skills add`.
  Fixed `depth=0` producing a root SKILL.md without a subdirectory wrapper.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 0e42bc0: Added native skill installation.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- dfd804c: Added ability for a root command to have both a `run` handler and subcommands. Subcommands take precedence — unmatched tokens fall back to the root handler. `--help` shows both root command usage and the subcommand list.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 370d039: Fixed commands returning `undefined` being serialized as the literal string `"undefined"` in output. Void commands now produce no output in human and machine modes. MCP tool calls with undefined results now return valid JSON (`null`) instead of broken output.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 09e4d76: Initial release.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 9c7f8aa: Updated SKILL.md
- 3d38f2d: Added usage info at end of description frontmatter in skills.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 1318c14: Initial release
